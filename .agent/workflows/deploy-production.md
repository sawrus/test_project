## Steps

### 1. Pre-flight — `@team-lead`
- **Input:** version tag
- **Actions:** confirm version tag exists and CI passed; verify staging is healthy with same version; check active incidents — HALT if P0/P1 open; post to `#deployments`: "Deploying <version> to production"
- **Output:** pre-flight sign-off
- **Done when:** all checks pass; team notified

### 2. Canary (10% traffic) — `@developer`
- **Input:** pre-flight sign-off
- **Actions:** deploy new image to canary pod group; monitor 5 minutes:
  - error rate delta > 0.5% → AUTO-ROLLBACK
  - p99 latency delta > 500ms → AUTO-ROLLBACK
  - pod crash loops → AUTO-ROLLBACK
- **Output:** canary health metrics
- **Done when:** canary stable for 5 minutes

### 3. Progressive Rollout — `@developer`
- **Input:** healthy canary
- **Actions:** 25% → wait 2 min → 50% → wait 2 min → 100%; continue SLO monitoring at each step; rollback if any threshold breached
- **Output:** 100% traffic on new version
- **Done when:** full rollout complete with no SLO breaches

### 4. Post-Deploy Validation — `@qa`
- **Input:** fully deployed version
- **Actions:** run smoke test suite against production; verify key business metrics not degraded > 10%; confirm monitoring dashboards reflect new version baseline
- **Output:** smoke test results; metric comparison
- **Done when:** all smoke tests pass; metrics stable

### 5. Complete — `@pm`
- **Input:** validated deployment
- **Actions:** post success to `#deployments` and status page; if rollback was triggered — create P1 incident, preserve logs, assign postmortem
- **Output:** `deployment_report.md`
- **Done when:** team and stakeholders informed

## Exit
Green smoke tests + stable metrics + deployment report = release complete.
